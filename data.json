In Turing&rsquo;s time, those rote-workers were in fact called &ldquo;computers,&rdquo; and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The&nbsp;<em>Entscheidungsproblem<\/em>&nbsp;sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the&nbsp;<em>Entscheidungsproblem<\/em>&nbsp;problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent&nbsp;<a class=\"md-crosslink autoxref\" href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/formal-system\">formal system<\/a>&nbsp;of arithmetic has an effective decision method.

It was in the course of his work on the&nbsp;<em>Entscheidungsproblem<\/em>&nbsp;that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that&nbsp;<a class=\"md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off\" href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/encapsulates\" data-term=\"encapsulates\">encapsulates<\/a>&nbsp;the fundamental logical principles of the&nbsp;<a class=\"md-crosslink autoxref\" href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/technology\/digital-computer\">digital computer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"h2\">The Church-Turing thesis<\/h2>\n<p>An important step in Turing&rsquo;s argument about the&nbsp;<em>Entscheidungsproblem<\/em>&nbsp;was the claim, now called the&nbsp;<span id=\"ref704266\"><\/span><a class=\"md-crosslink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/science\/Churchs-thesis\">Church-Turing thesis<\/a>, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church&rsquo;s thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing&rsquo;s work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing&rsquo;s formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine &ldquo;has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness&hellip;evident immediately.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<\/section>",

Although most healthy infants and toddlers reach each milestone within a specific window of time, there is much variation as to how wide that window may be. For example,&nbsp;<a class=\"md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off\" href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/culture\" data-term=\"culture\">culture<\/a>,&nbsp;<a class=\"md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off\" href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/environment\" data-term=\"environment\">environment<\/a>, socioeconomic status, and genetic factors can influence when an infant or toddler will begin to crawl, walk, or talk. Children who suffer from undernutrition, who lack social stimuli, or who lack access to proper health care may develop more slowly than children in more enriched&nbsp;<a class=\"md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off\" href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/environments\" data-term=\"environments\">environments<\/a>. Concerns about infant or toddler development arise when milestones are absent or significantly delayed, since such situations may signal an underlying physical or mental condition. Identifying problems early in development is vital to a child&rsquo;s health. Although parents are often the first to raise concerns, teachers and child care workers may spot problems that parents have not noticed or have been afraid to acknowledge. They may also be able to identify abused or neglected children who exhibit abnormal development.<\/p>\n<p>Early in the 20th century,&nbsp;<a class=\"md-crosslink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/science\/child-development-process\">child development<\/a>&nbsp;scholars began to understand that children were not just &ldquo;small adults&rdquo; but individuals with unique personalities and distinct needs. In the 1920s and &rsquo;30s Swiss psychologist&nbsp;<span id=\"ref1184017\"><\/span><a class=\"md-crosslink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/biography\/Jean-Piaget\">Jean Piaget<\/a>&nbsp;developed a theory that children&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class=\"md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off\" href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/cognitive\" data-term=\"cognitive\">cognitive<\/a>&nbsp;abilities progress through four stages. According to Piaget, a sensorimotor stage characterized the first two years of life, during which time a child also becomes aware of the permanence of existence of objects in his or her environment. The work of Russian psychologist&nbsp;<a class=\"md-crosslink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/biography\/L-S-Vygotsky\">Lev S. Vygotsky<\/a>, which reached English-speaking audiences around the same time as Piaget&rsquo;s research, provided insight into how children think and develop language.<\/p>\n<p>In 1933 the&nbsp;<span id=\"ref1184018\"><\/span>Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD) was established in the&nbsp;<a class=\"md-crosslink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/place\/United-States\">United States<\/a>&nbsp;to apply new concepts in child development to improving the lives of the country&rsquo;s children. The society initially focused on understanding how&nbsp;<a class=\"md-crosslink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/poverty\">poverty<\/a>&nbsp;and social deprivation affected development, with the aim of using that knowledge to design policies and programs to&nbsp;<a class=\"md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off\" href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/alleviate\" data-term=\"alleviate\">alleviate<\/a>&nbsp;the negative effects of poverty.

Even after the provinces of the Netherlands united, Holland was still the dominant region. The cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague are in the Hollands.
